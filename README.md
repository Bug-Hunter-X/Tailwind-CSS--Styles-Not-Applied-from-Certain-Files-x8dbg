# Tailwind CSS Styles Not Applied from Certain Files

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Tailwind CSS where styles from specific files or directories are not being applied, despite the files seemingly being correctly included in the `content` array of the `tailwind.config.js` file.  The problem may arise from typos, incorrect file paths, or other less obvious reasons.

## Bug Description

The `bug.js` file showcases the problem.  The `tailwind.config.js` file contains the `content` array with what appears to be correct paths to the files, yet some styles are still missing. 

## Solution

The solution, demonstrated in `bugSolution.js`, addresses potential issues and provides a way to ensure that all your files are properly included.

## How to reproduce the bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev` (assuming you've configured a development server).
4. Observe the missing styles, which demonstrates the issue.
